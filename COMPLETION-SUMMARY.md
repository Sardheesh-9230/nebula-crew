## 🔧 Known Issues & Fixes Needed

### Issue 1: Medical Record Creation (Priority: Medium)
**Problem:** Citizens cannot create medical records  
**Error:** "User role citizen is not authorized to access this route"  
**Impact:** Users cannot add their own medical records  
**Fix Required:** Update role permissions in `medicalRecordRoutes.js`

### Issue 2: Appointment Creation (Priority: Medium)
**Problem:** Appointment creation validation error  
**Error:** "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'start')"  
**Impact:** Users cannot book appointments  
**Fix Required:** Review appointment schema and date field handling

### Issue 3: SHO Authentication (Priority: Low)
**Problem:** SHO login credentials failing  
**Error:** "Invalid credentials"  
**Impact:** Cannot test SHO-specific features  
**Fix Required:** Create proper SHO user in database or reset credentials
