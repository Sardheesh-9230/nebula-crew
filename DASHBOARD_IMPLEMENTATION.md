## 📋 Mock Data vs Real API

### Current Status: **MOCK DATA**
All dashboards currently use mock data arrays for demonstration. Each dashboard needs API integration.

### API Endpoints Needed:

**State Officer Dashboard:**
```javascript
GET /api/v1/state/health-stats
GET /api/v1/state/disease-trends
GET /api/v1/state/district-distribution
GET /api/v1/state/vaccination-progress
GET /api/v1/state/resource-allocation
GET /api/v1/state/alerts
```

**Regional Officer Dashboard:**
```javascript
GET /api/v1/region/:id/stats
GET /api/v1/region/:id/outbreaks
GET /api/v1/region/:id/proximity-alerts
GET /api/v1/region/:id/high-risk-cases
GET /api/v1/region/:id/facilities
GET /api/v1/region/:id/performance
POST /api/v1/region/:id/send-alert
```

**Doctor Dashboard:**
```javascript
GET /api/v1/doctor/appointments/today
GET /api/v1/doctor/patients/recent
GET /api/v1/doctor/patients/search?query=
GET /api/v1/doctor/patients/:id
GET /api/v1/doctor/patients/:id/vitals
POST /api/v1/doctor/patients/:id/records
POST /api/v1/doctor/patients/:id/flag
GET /api/v1/doctor/alerts
```
