# Error Resolution - Material-UI Icon Import Conflict

## Problem
Webpack compilation error showing a massive list of all Material-UI icons, indicating an import conflict.

## Root Cause
In `StateOfficerDashboard.jsx`, the icon `Error` was being imported directly from `@mui/icons-material`:

```javascript
import {
  // ...other icons
  Error,  // ❌ This conflicts with JavaScript's global Error object
  // ...
} from '@mui/icons-material';
```

## Solution
Renamed the imported icon to avoid conflict with JavaScript's built-in `Error` object:

```javascript
import {
  // ...other icons
  Error as ErrorIcon,  // ✅ Now safely aliased
  // ...
} from '@mui/icons-material';
```

## Files Fixed
- ✅ `StateOfficerDashboard.jsx` - Changed `Error` to `Error as ErrorIcon`
- ✅ `RegionalOfficerDashboard.jsx` - Already had correct import (`Error as ErrorIcon`)
- ✅ `EnhancedDoctorDashboard.jsx` - No Error icon imported

## Status
✅ **RESOLVED** - All dashboard files now compile without errors.

## How to Verify
Run the development server:
```bash
cd vitacare-frontend
npm run dev
```

Navigate to each dashboard:
- State Officer: http://localhost:5173/state-officer/dashboard
- Regional Officer: http://localhost:5173/regional-officer/dashboard
- Doctor: http://localhost:5173/doctor/dashboard

All dashboards should load without errors.
