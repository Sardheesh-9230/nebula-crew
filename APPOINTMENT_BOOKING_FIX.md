# Appointment Booking System - Complete Fix

## API Endpoints Verified âœ…

### Backend Routes (Correct)
```javascript
// In app.js
app.use('/api/v1/appointments', appointmentRoutes);

// appointmentRoutes handles:
GET    /api/v1/appointments          -> getAppointments (fetch all)
POST   /api/v1/appointments          -> bookAppointment (create new)
GET    /api/v1/appointments/:id      -> getAppointment (fetch one)
PUT    /api/v1/appointments/:id      -> updateAppointment
DELETE /api/v1/appointments/:id      -> cancelAppointment
```

### Frontend API Calls (Correct)
```javascript
// In appointmentsSlice.js
GET  /appointments  -> http://localhost:5000/api/v1/appointments
POST /appointments  -> http://localhost:5000/api/v1/appointments
```

### API Configuration
- âœ… Backend running on: `http://localhost:5000`
- âœ… Frontend running on: `http://localhost:5173`
- âœ… API Base URL: `http://localhost:5000/api/v1`
- âœ… CORS configured for both ports 3000 and 5173

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Appointment Not Storing in Database**
- âœ… Fixed time conversion logic in `BookAppointment.jsx` - now properly converts 12-hour format (e.g., "09:00 AM") to 24-hour format (e.g., "09:00")
- âœ… Enhanced backend validation in `appointmentController.js` with detailed logging
- âœ… Added proper error handling for missing or invalid timeSlot structure
- âœ… Made doctorId and hospitalId optional to allow booking without selecting specific doctors/hospitals

### 2. **Appointments Not Displaying After Booking**
- âœ… Added `getAppointments()` dispatch after successful booking to refresh the appointments list
- âœ… Changed redirect from `/dashboard` to `/appointments` so users see their booked appointments immediately
- âœ… Added proper loading states and error handling in Redux slice
- âœ… Enhanced Redux action logging for better debugging

### 3. **Enhanced Logging and Debugging**
- âœ… Added comprehensive logging in `getAppointments` controller
- âœ… Added logging in Redux actions for booking and fetching
- âœ… Added CORS origin logging to track cross-origin requests
- âœ… Shows MongoDB query being executed
- âœ… Shows number of appointments found

### 4. **CORS Configuration Improvement**
- âœ… Updated CORS to accept multiple origins (port 3000 and 5173)
- âœ… Added CORS logging to track blocked/allowed requests
- âœ… Allow requests with no origin (for testing with Postman/curl)

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Restart Backend Server
```bash
cd vitacare-backend
# Press Ctrl+C to stop current server
npm start
```

### 2. Test Appointment Booking Flow

#### Step 1: Login
- Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/login`
- Login with your patient credentials (UHI or mobile number)

#### Step 2: Book Appointment
- Click "Book Appointment" from Dashboard or navigate to `/book-appointment`
- Follow the 4-step process:
  1. **Select Type**: Choose Video Consultation or In-Person Visit, select Specialization
  2. **Choose Date & Time**: Pick a future date and a time slot
  3. **Add Details**: Enter reason and symptoms (optional)
  4. **Confirm**: Review and click "Book Appointment"

#### Step 3: Verify Appointment
- After booking, you should be redirected to `/appointments`
- Your new appointment should appear at the top of the "Upcoming" tab
- Check the details: date, time, type, reason, status should be "scheduled"

### 3. Check Database (Optional)

#### Using MongoDB Compass or mongosh:
```javascript
use vitacare

// Check latest appointments
db.appointments.find().sort({ createdAt: -1 }).limit(5).pretty()

// Check your specific appointment
db.appointments.find({ 
  patientId: ObjectId("YOUR_USER_ID")
}).pretty()
```

### 4. Check Console Logs

#### Backend Console Should Show:
```
=== BOOKING APPOINTMENT ===
Request body: {
  "appointmentDate": "2025-10-25",
  "timeSlot": {
    "start": "09:00",
    "end": "10:00"
  },
  "type": "telemedicine",
  "reason": "General Physician consultation",
  "symptoms": [],
  "consultationFee": 500
}
User ID: 6xxxxxxxxxxxxx
Processed appointment data: { ... }
Appointment created successfully: { ... }
```

#### Frontend Console Should Show:
```
Booking appointment with data: { ... }
Redux: Booking appointment with data: { ... }
Redux: Appointment booked successfully: { ... }
```

## Expected Results

âœ… Appointment saves to MongoDB with all fields
âœ… Appointment appears in the appointments list immediately
âœ… User redirected to /appointments page
âœ… Success toast notification appears
âœ… Loading state shows during booking process
âœ… No duplicate submissions possible

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Appointment date and time slot are required"
**Solution**: Check that date field has a value in format "YYYY-MM-DD" and timeSlot is selected

### Issue: "Time slot must have start and end times"
**Solution**: Verify the time conversion is working - check console logs for timeSlot structure

### Issue: Appointment not appearing in list
**Solution**: 
1. Check if user is logged in (JWT token present)
2. Open browser DevTools â†’ Network tab â†’ check GET /api/v1/appointments response
3. Verify appointment's patientId matches your user._id

### Issue: 401 Unauthorized
**Solution**: 
1. Check if token exists in localStorage
2. Try logging out and logging back in
3. Check backend auth middleware

## Database Schema Reference

```javascript
{
  appointmentId: "APTXXXXXXXX",  // Auto-generated
  patientId: ObjectId,            // Required - from req.user._id
  doctorId: ObjectId,             // Optional
  hospitalId: ObjectId,           // Optional
  appointmentDate: Date,          // Required - "YYYY-MM-DD"
  timeSlot: {
    start: String,                // Required - "HH:MM" (24-hour)
    end: String                   // Required - "HH:MM" (24-hour)
  },
  type: String,                   // "in-person" or "telemedicine"
  status: String,                 // Default: "scheduled"
  reason: String,
  symptoms: [String],
  consultationFee: Number,
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

## Next Steps

1. âœ… **Immediate**: Restart backend and test appointment booking
2. ðŸ”„ **Short-term**: Add actual Doctor and Hospital selection from database
3. ðŸ”„ **Medium-term**: Implement payment integration
4. ðŸ”„ **Long-term**: Add appointment reminders and notifications

## Support

If appointments are still not saving or displaying:
1. Check backend console for detailed error logs
2. Check browser console for Redux action logs
3. Verify MongoDB connection is active
4. Check network requests in DevTools â†’ Network tab
5. Verify user is authenticated (token in localStorage)
