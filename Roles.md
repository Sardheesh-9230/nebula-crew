Okay, let's break down the detailed content and processing for separate dashboards for the **State Health Office**, **Regional Health Office**, and **Doctor** within your DHRMS React.js web application.

This will involve defining the purpose, key metrics, data sources, and how each interacts with the system.

## **I. Dashboard Overview & Purpose**

Each dashboard serves a distinct user persona with specific responsibilities:

1.  **State Health Office Dashboard:**
    * **Purpose:** High-level strategic oversight, policy-making, resource allocation, and pan-state health intelligence. Focus on aggregated, anonymized data, and long-term trends.
    * **User:** State-level government officials, health secretaries, public health directors.

2.  **Regional Health Office Dashboard:**
    * **Purpose:** Operational management, localized outbreak response, resource deployment within a specific district/region, and supervision of local clinics/doctors. Focus on granular regional data and real-time alerts.
    * **User:** District medical officers, regional health coordinators, local public health teams.

3.  **Doctor Dashboard:**
    * **Purpose:** Patient-centric management, clinical decision support, and personal workload oversight. Focus on individual patient records, appointments, and direct interactions.

## **III. Technical Implementation Considerations (React.js)**

1.  **Authentication & Authorization (Role-Based Access Control - RBAC):**
    * Use `React Router` to protect routes.
    * Store user role (State Admin, Regional Admin, Doctor) in your global state (Redux/Context) upon login.
    * Conditional rendering: Components/features within a dashboard should only appear if the user's role permits it.

2.  **API Endpoints:**
    * **State Health Office:** Primarily consumes aggregated, anonymized data (`GET /api/state/health-intelligence`, `GET /api/state/disease-heatmap`, `POST /api/state/broadcast-alert`).
    * **Regional Health Office:** Consumes region-specific data (`GET /api/region/:id/health-overview`, `GET /api/region/:id/outbreaks`, `POST /api/region/:id/issue-alert`).
    * **Doctor:** Focuses on individual patient data (`GET /api/patient/:uhi`, `POST /api/doctor/record`, `GET /api/doctor/appointments`).

3.  **State Management (Redux Toolkit/Context):**
    * **Global State:** User authentication (token, role, user details), regional ID (for Regional Office), global alerts.
    * **Component Local State:** Form inputs, loading states, modal visibility.
    * **Data Fetching:** Use `RTK Query` (part of Redux Toolkit) or `React Query` for efficient data fetching, caching, and invalidation.

4.  **UI/UX Considerations:**
    * **Responsive Design:** All dashboards must work well on various screen sizes (laptops, large monitors).
    * **Data Visualization:** Utilize libraries like `Chart.js`, `Recharts`, or `D3.js` for graphs, heatmaps, and tables.
    * **Consistent Design System:** Use Material-UI or Ant Design to maintain a unified look and feel across all dashboards.
    * **Accessibility:** Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard-navigable and screen-reader friendly.

5.  **Performance:**
    * **Lazy Loading:** Implement `React.lazy` and `Suspense` for dashboard components to reduce initial bundle size.
    * **Data Pagination/Virtualization:** For large tables (e.g., patient lists), use pagination or react-window/react-virtualized.
    * **Memoization:** Use `React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

6.  **Real-time Updates:**
    * For alerts, new cases, or SOS calls, consider **WebSockets** (e.g., using Socket.IO) to push updates from the server to the relevant dashboards without constant polling.

By segmenting the data and functionality based on these roles, you ensure each user gets a tailored, efficient, and relevant experience within the DHRMS web portal.
